\topic{Introductions}
Dr Weddell started the call and began the meeting - he suggested that each member of the team introduce
themselves. Dan began, stating that he would take the lead on Machine Learning. Calin then stated that he
would be more involved in the hardware implementation side. Next, Emily introduced herself as the primary
for the embedded implementation. Toby then said that he would be focusing on the abstract design of the
algorithm. Finally, Mohit greeted the customer and informed him that he would also be managing the
hardware side of the project.

\topic{Project Plan}
Emily began proceedings by asking James if he had seen the proposed project brief - James said that
he had not, so Emily briefly went over it. James said that this sounded sensible and asked if the group
were aware what ARM's particular interests were - Emily said that the team would like clarification on
that so James explained that ARM were working on their subthreshold Cortex M0+ processor and briefly
mentioned that this would mean reduced voltages (of around 1.2V) and reduced frequencies. He stated
that any software, therefore, that was to be run on the device would need to be designed in the knowledge
that it would have very few processessing cycles availible to it and that the memory would be very small.
He mentioned that, as a result of this, the systems they had built so far had tended to swap between
collecting data and processing data, rather than processing data on the fly, as the processing ability
was so low. Emily clarified that this mean that ARM's interests were to see what was the most the team
could ``get away with'' running on the device, which James agreed with.
