\topic{Project Brief}
Emily apologised for sending the latest draft of the brief so close to the meeting. Dr Merret said
he had not yet had a chance to go over it, so Emily went over the changes since the previous
version; she stated that his points had all been accepted by the team, and explained that many of
them they had been planning to do anyway, but agreed that the brief was too vague. She answered
Dr Merrett's question [Note: Via email before the meeting, Dr Merrett had queried what the Brief
meant when it referred to ``other Service Oriented Architectures"] stating that the team had meant
algorithms running on unconstrained systems.

Dr Merrett said he was happy with everything - his only note
was that the brief said ``an algorithm... for execution on... [a] subthreshold device". He suggested
adding ``suitable for" to make it clear that the team would not actually be working with the
subthreshold device in question. Emily pointed out that Dan had made a change which she had not yet
had a chance to see - Dan explained this was simply to add a reference to existing tools used for
Machine Learning, such as Waka. The group were all happy with this. Dr Weddell had no issues, other
than a typo he had noticed in the Gantt chart. Emily apologised and said she'd make sure to spell
check it before submitting.

Dr Merrett said that the brief should also be emailed to the client - Emily asked if he would like
to be CCed on that, to which Dr Merrett replied that he would. Toby asked if the Gantt charts should
also be sent over, but Dr Merrett said it would probably be better to do without those.
