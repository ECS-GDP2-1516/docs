\topic{Project Brief}
Emily apologised for sending the latest draft of the brief so close to the meeting. Dr Merret said
he had not yet had a chance to go over it, so Emily went over the changes since the previous
version; she stated that his points had all been accepted by the team, and explained that many of
them they had been planning to do anyway, but agreed that the brief was too vague. She answered
Dr Merrett's question [Note: Via email before the meeting, Dr Merrett had queried what the Brief
meant when it referred to ``other Service Oriented Architectures"] stating that the team had meant
algorithms running on unconstrained systems.

Dr Merrett said he was happy with everything - his only note
was that the brief said ``an algorithm... for execution on... [a] subthreshold device". He suggested
adding ``suitable for" to make it clear that the team would not actually be working with the
subthreshold device in question. Emily pointed out that Dan had made a change which she had not yet
had a chance to see - Dan explained this was simply to add a reference to existing tools used for
Machine Learning, such as Waka. The group were all happy with this. Dr Weddell had no issues, other
than a typo he had noticed in the Gantt chart. Emily apologised and said she'd make sure to spell
check it before submitting.

Dr Merrett said that the brief should also be emailed to the client - Emily asked if he would like
to be CCed on that, to which Dr Merrett replied that he would. Toby asked if the Gantt charts should
also be sent over, but Dr Merrett said it would probably be better to do without those.

\topic{Project Administration}
Mohit asked about gaining access to the code required for the M0 - Dr Merrett stated that he should
try signing up to ARM's site, although mentioned that there might be a single person who is signed
up for the whole University who he should contact.

Dr Merrett then asked how things had gone with the group so far for the week, and Toby responded
that they had been working on the Ethics Approval. Emily mentioned that the plan is to complete
the required forms this week, ready for the possible two weeks of processing time. Dr Merrett
said that, in order to submit the request, the team would have to have a clear idea of what their
testing would be - Toby said he had planned to write about the excersises, Emily added that testing
non-excersise motions would be sensible too, to ensure the algorithm does not give false-positives.

Dr Weddell asked to be reminded if the algorithm was aimed at inflight usage, and stated that that
would add some convienient constraints on the requirements, as measuring activities such as walking
up stairs may not be required. Dr Merrett pointed out that some planes do in fact have stairs,
however the team accepted Dr Weddell's point - Emily added that movement due to turbalence may
need to be considered.

Dr Merrett also pointed out that there may be two phases of testing required: the first to obtain
the data, and a second to verify that the system worked correctly. Emily said they had planned this
but weren't sure if this should be submitted as separate requests - Dr Merrett stated that one
request would be appropriate and informed the group that, while the ethics committee do require
precision and detail in the application, if possible be as general as possible within those
constraints.

Emily briefly touched upon to topic of risk assessments - Dr Merrett suggested that allergies may
be one as the device will involve skin contact. He suggested that using the device over clothes
would be a sufficiant way to avoid this risk.

Mohit then reminded the group about Laboratory Risk assessments. Emily handed their completed
risk statements to Dr Merrett who counter signed each of them. He asked why he only needed to sign
one per team member, as other teams had given him more to sign. Emily stated that she believed
copying the forms once signed would be fine which Dr Merrett accepted.

\topic{Hardware}

Emily brought up a topic of confusion for the group at their previous meeting\footnote
{2015-05-05, Background Research, Paragraph 2}: the M0's long term memory capability.
Dr Merrett was unsure what flash memory would be availiable and this may be something worth
talking to the customer about. Dr Weddell looked up the M0 and found there were two versions:
one with 256B of flash memory and 32kB of RAM, and a smaller unit with a total of 32kB flash
and RAM, of which 8kB is RAM.

\topic{Project Plan}
Dr Merrett asked what the team's project plan was.

\subtopic{Hardware}
Emily started with hardware - she went over the contents of the Gantt chart, stating that they
planned to spend the next week begining the process of acquiring the required items, and they
had planned to have a working system built just in time for the planned data collection week
if the suppliers are slow.

Dr Merrett asked if this plan implied the team were planning on using the
device itself to collect the training data, which Emily confirmed. He suggested this was a
poor strategy as it would be easier to simply use a fully working device to collect high
precision data. Mohit stated that the formats may be different which could cause a problem,
however Emily interjected that she believed that data conversion shouldn't be difficult,
assuming both formats are adequately documented.

\subtopic{Software}
Emily then explained the software side of the project's planning, stating that the plan is
to spend the next couple of weeks dealing with ``administration" tasks such as the ethics
approval, quickly leading onto the reasearch phase. She said the team had decided to research
Machine Learning for recognising excersises on non constrained systems at first, followed by
research into Machine Learning in general on constrained systems.

She then said the next few weeks were dedicated to starting to develop an algorithm, first
just in a high level language such as Java, both to help with planing the algorithm and to
give the hardware side time to get the system working before work started. Finally, she said
they would move into the embedded development of the team's chosen algorithm.

Dr Merrett started that this course of action was sensible and asked if the research was going
to focus on practical solutions or academic research. Emily responded that they had planned
both, although she didn't have a strong response as they had not made a start on the literature
at that point.
