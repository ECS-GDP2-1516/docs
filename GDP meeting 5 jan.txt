5th Jan GDP Meeting

Selected parameters to use with the algorithm

Emiliy has got the algorithm to compile

Next tasks are to get it working on the device and then test it with the user studies. Will need to interface between
the model and the hardware so we can flash an LED when it detects exercise being performed.
Additionally, get a structure for the report, plan who is doing each section. Focus on report in last week. Get the device working ASAP.

As with the tradeoffs, we seem to be using about 10Hz samping frequency
Also we have decided on the window size


We have the system clock controlled on the mBed device and have the sensors working on there now


Remotely work with Emiliy while she is away


Also get a plan done this week, email progress next week


Next meeting on the 18th at 2pm
